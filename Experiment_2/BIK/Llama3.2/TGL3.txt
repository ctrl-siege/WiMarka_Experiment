How many people can you count, Sakang?
Tiang Pas is crying for the two of us to mourn together.
... My son, he's the one I love!
We're like father and son.
The great nation is being mocked by those who have no shame or poverty.
Some listen, some brag!
The children said, 'This is written in the clouds!'
Oh, I love you too, Pedrito, many times I didn't see you because of the rosary.
The poor are searching for some Tagalog people with no shame!
We're all suffering together.
It shouldn't happen like this, let's support each other, let's support the government so that it doesn't reach our doorsteps, let's show support for the government.
Our ancestors didn't suffer like this!
I'm not a citizen of the new republic, with Heneral Emilio Aguinaldo as president.
Two are mourning!
We're like father and son.
You shouldn't have me as a witness, just one little soldier!
Your weapons are at your doorstep!
The Tagalogs who came before us!
Look at your children, Silvestre, they're crying too, why are you not taking action against the government?
It's not too late for me, I'll show them how to replace them with better ones!
I have a lot of words to say!
...I'm loving you, my dear!
Don't tell me we won't find another way!
As the Lord said before, 'Let there be a new creation,' let me take care of this world instead!
