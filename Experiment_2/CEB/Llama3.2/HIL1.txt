Hello, we had a fun time today.
There's no other word for "Balayan" in the Bagobo language.
Many have an effective influence now.
We went to Gumalang just for the sake of Kasaulogan in Pulong.
The Balayan will help them, Lando and Berto, on the boat.
We ate with balayan and saw some ants on top of our food.
The town is laughing at Lando's joke, but he didn't laugh back.
If there are no more fairies, then nothing happens to you.
Dodong saw Dokdok, but there's no one else around him where he fell asleep.
Even if his eyes are still open, even though his face is smiling with excitement and pride, I just can't stand up or take notice.
His eyes were fixed on the crowd.
Then he threw a grenade into the air from the rooftop.
But they were still able to hear his shout and some people kept moving forward on their journey.
Iyo Boloy was looking at a young girl who was looking back at him.
Iyo Boloy was drinking beer in a bamboo hut with an avocado plant from the soil.
That's how it was that his hair stood up on his head.
Even when he called out, Iya Petra and the other customers didn't notice him at the market or in the orchard.
Hey Dong, I'm sorry that you're tired.
He was looking forward to seeing the people of Sanpilar when he came back.
He saw his true self when he fell asleep with his wife who was snoring beside him.
His awareness of the gun was interrupted.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
His thoughts were not paying attention to the night.
Even if I was born with no one around, there's still a story waiting for me.
It is quiet now and they are sleeping.
