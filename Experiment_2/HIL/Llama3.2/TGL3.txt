I saw his real nature when I met Kadlum.
Oh, how I hate both of you!
So I'm going out to the balcony.
Those gossiping people, but I see them!
You should treat your children with kindness and respect.
Oh, I see that you're still holding onto the wind!
It's natural for someone like your grandfather to be long-lived.
The result of his cruel heart is this!
Oh, I see you have something there!

Let's strive for justice!
All I wanted was someone like Kadlum, even if I had to die for it!
The time of suffering has come!
There's only one thing left to do - finish!
We are the ones who will endure hardship!
But what's just? Our justice is only a curse!
