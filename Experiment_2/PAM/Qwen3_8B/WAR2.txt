What is the reason for your sorrow, my heart, as you are lost in the night?
Do you still look at the sky of Pampanga?
Does your soul speak to you, and do you still seek?
The culture of the people, can you carry it forward?
Do you feel the pain of your wings, my love, or is it just a dream?
What is the reason for your silence, as the stars shine?
Do you have time to take a moment, as the days pass?
A noble path, what are you writing?
What is the message your heart carries at night?
The joyful and graceful ones, who will go to you, as the sky meets the sea?
The silence of the night, will you still remain?
I will take you, Apu; I will take you back.
Poeta Zaldo Abner, you are the one, take it.
The people of Pampanga, where are you?
Why do you not speak, as the moon shines?
Tell me, Madam Gloria, what is the reason you write?
What is the reason for your silence, among the people of Pampanga?
For you, the people of Pampanga, will you remain?
Why do you look at your heart, as you are lost?
The one who loves you, why do you not accept them?
The silence of your heart, and the pain of your soul?
The culture of the people, can you carry it forward?
The truth of the people, will you still seek?
The path of the child, who will guide you?
Why do you not go to the one who is wrong?
